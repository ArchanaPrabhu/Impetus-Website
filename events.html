                <p>The participants would be given a chart and sketch pens. They are supposed to innovate or upgrade a part of vehicle
                    for better efficiency and less cost/pollution which could be practically possible. The participants are supposed
                    to put the theory into a graph or a design and they have to present it to the judges after which there will be
                    a questionnaire by the judges.</p>
